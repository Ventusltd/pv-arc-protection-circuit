1. Purpose

This open hardware design provides embedded protection against DC arc faults, insulation leakage, and cable or connector failures within photovoltaic (PV) modules. It enables sub-microsecond autonomous disconnection at module level, mitigating the risks of fire, electrocution, and backfeed faults. No microcontroller, PLC, or inverter coordination is required.

⸻

2. Problem Statement

Existing PV protection relies on string-level detection or external rapid shutdown devices. These approaches often fail to prevent:
	•	Insulation breakdown to frame or ground
	•	Arc faults in connectors or junction boxes
	•	Sustained voltage after cable breaks
	•	Backfeed currents up to 40 A from paralleled strings
	•	Unsafe voltage presence during maintenance or emergencies

Standard fuses and AFCIs often miss low-current faults or trip too late. Battery cells are already protected individually. Solar modules must follow suit.

3. Solution Overview

The proposed circuit integrates within the module junction box and includes:
	•	High-speed N-MOSFET disconnection (<1 µs)
	•	Passive snubber and TVS for arc energy absorption
	•	Analog fault detection:
	•	Voltage divider for insulation leakage (PV– to frame)
	•	Shunt resistor and RC integrator for arc precursors
	•	Cable break detection via sunlight + no current logic
	•	Failsafe design (opens on power loss)
	•	Integrated bypass diodes for current continuity

No firmware, signal bus, or central logic required.

Questions for prototype iterations 

While the design logic is sound, early real-world testing could expose issues like false trips from humidity, EMI, or transient shading—especially without tuned hysteresis or filtering. There’s also risk that fast MOSFET switching, if not properly suppressed, could damage components or fail to interrupt high backfeed safely. Should we include minimal analog tuning (e.g. RC filters or comparator hysteresis) before testing to avoid early failures and reduce the need for multiple prototype iterations?

Improvements to consider againt nuisance trips along thermal management
- Comparator U1: TLV7012 (no hysteresis)
+ TLV7032 (6mV hysteresis, push-pull output)

- Snubber: 2.2µF film cap
+ 4.7µF X7R (higher surge absorption)

+ Add MOV across gate-source (Vgs clamp)

7. Economic Justification

For a 660 Wp module priced at $0.08/Wp (~$52.80), this circuit adds approximately $1.80 in cost — around 3.4%.

This is minor compared to the real-world costs of:
	•	Structural or vegetation fires
	•	Electrocution injuries or fatalities
	•	Inverter or transformer destruction
	•	Long-term degradation from galvanic corrosion
	•	Liability or compliance failures

In dry climates like California, Spain, Greece, or Portugal, and during UK droughts with dry grass, even one DC arc can trigger a wildfire. Prevention at module level is the safest and most scalable strategy.

Estimated: 35×45 mm PCB, <10 mm height, 2 oz copper, ~15 components, 40 A rated, single-sided SMD, no MCU, low-to-moderate complexity, SMT reflow compatible, fits standard Staubli/Amphenol J-boxes.

11. Proof of concept from other industries

This circuit senses DC arc risk, insulation leakage, or abnormal current using passive analog components. It reacts in microseconds without software. This type of sensing is already trusted in high-risk environments.

In electric vehicles it senses overcurrent or thermal imbalance in battery strings. Fast MOSFET disconnect protects against thermal runaway.

In satellites it senses voltage deviation or current ripple on DC buses. The analog design is used because it survives radiation and prevents electrical arcs in vacuum.

In railway DC systems it senses conductor faults or water ingress. Analog isolation circuits open before arcs escalate into fires.

In telecom base stations it senses insulation breakdown or line damage. Protection is autonomous because remote systems can’t wait for cloud logic.

In photovoltaic systems this is the first use of fast analog arc sensing directly inside a junction box. By sensing ripple, leakage, or loss of current while sunlight is present, the system prevents fire, shock, or backfeed. The circuit is simple enough to manufacture at scale and rugged enough to deploy globally.

This kind of sensing replaces expensive or complex solutions with something fail-safe, proven in harsher sectors, and now ready for solar.

12. Mission: Disconnection Under Load for Worker Safety

This circuit enables local disconnection under load, even during active power generation, to protect field technicians and reduce electrocution risk during testing, commissioning, and fault handling of 1000–1500 VDC strings.

Unlike traditional systems that rely on inverter shutdowns or manual string isolators, this approach provides autonomous, module-level fault isolation.

It parallels the fault response used in lithium battery packs and aerospace electronics, where local protection circuits detect fault conditions and disconnect the cell or load path instantly. Applying the same philosophy to PV modules allows for safer, decentralized DC architectures at scale.

This is a key step toward high-voltage, touch-safe DC systems for clean energy infrastructure. 

13. Module-Level Overload Protection (Transformer & Inverter Safety) - Intelligent DC and AC load flow studies possibilities

Overview
This enhancement builds on the core arc suppression circuit by introducing a secondary function: proactive disconnection during transformer or inverter overload conditions. It uses the same high-speed MOSFETs already present for safety switching.

Problem
In large-scale PV plants, sudden irradiance changes or low grid demand can lead to thermal overload of inverters and magnetic saturation** of MV transformers. Traditional systems respond too late or rely on inverter logic that may already be compromised.

Solution
This circuit allows for **autonomous, module-level output throttling or shutdown in response to local or external signals indicating overproduction risk. The goal is not energy optimisation, but grid-conforming behavior and asset protection.

Key Differences from Voltage Optimisers
- Purpose: Protection, not yield gain
- Simplicity: No MCU, no tracking algorithm
- Trigger: Based on thermal stress, voltage rise, or grid signal—not mismatch
- Effect: Reduces DC-side power delivery before inverter or transformer strain occurs

Implementation Options
- Local analog sensing (e.g., string overvoltage)
- External enable/disable signal line from combiner or substation
- Optional future integration with SCADA alerts

Status
Prototype-ready. Function builds on existing architecture with minimal hardware changes.

Addendum: 

Standards Alignment and Regulatory Pressure

This open hardware design addresses critical safety risks in photovoltaic systems by providing local, module-level protection against arc faults, insulation leakage, and backfeed voltage. It is intended to support or exceed the safety objectives of current international and UK standards.
	1.	IEC 62548 – PV Array Design Requirements
Aligns with section 4.6: Protection against faults. Introduces early disconnection logic within the module rather than relying on distant string-level detection.
	2.	IEC 60364-7-712 – Electrical Installations (PV Systems)
Supports automatic disconnection requirements in response to insulation or fault conditions, reducing risk of fire or electrocution during operation or maintenance.
	3.	IEC TS 62738 – Arc Fault Protection
While focused on string-level detection, this design anticipates the necessary evolution toward source-level intervention to contain arcs early and safely.
	4.	UL 1699B / NEC 690.11 – Arc Fault Circuit Interruption
Meets the intent of US standards for rooftop PV safety, but does so through simpler, faster, and MCU-free analog mechanisms.
	5.	UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) – Electricity at Work Regulations 1989
This circuit directly supports employer duties under Regulation 4(1) and 8(1) to prevent electrical danger. It exposes the weakness of existing systems that leave high-voltage DC cables energised under fault conditions.

Interim Risk Acknowledgement
Until such safety circuits are standardised and embedded in module designs, it is vital that PV system operators conduct regular insulation resistance (Riso) testing—especially in large-scale arrays using 1000–1500 VDC strings. This is the only currently viable method to detect breakdowns that may otherwise go unnoticed until catastrophic failure occurs.

Fire Risk Context for Commercial Rooftop and Utility-Scale PV Systems

Recent incidents such as the rooftop PV fire at a Hospital in Bristol demonstrate that commercial buildings are increasingly vulnerable to electrical fires linked to photovoltaic systems. Large utility-scale solar farms often covering hundreds of hectares—also present significant wildfire hazards, particularly in drought-prone areas like southern Europe, California, and Australia. The 2025 Talaván PV fire in Spain burned over 800 hectares due to a fault in electrical conductors combined with dry vegetation, highlighting the systemic risk.

With over 2 terawatts of PV now installed globally and multi-terawatt annual deployment expected per NREL forecasts, the scale of risk is increasing. High-voltage string architectures (1000 to 1500 volts) and dense layouts raise both ignition potential and the challenge of fault isolation. This open hardware design addresses these risks by enabling autonomous, module-level fault disconnection—particularly relevant for rooftops where delayed access and structural vulnerability add to the danger.

Given the industry size and risk exposure, proactive safety integration must become the norm. This design is released with no commercial restrictions, available for immediate adoption and further development by manufacturers, universities, national labs, and standards committees.

Global Fire Risk Summary from DC PV Systems

Estimate global data on fires caused by DC-side faults (arcing, insulation breakdown, connector failure) is limited due to inconsistent reporting. However, credible industry estimates show a clear and rising safety risk:

| NREL (2025)                  | 0.016% annual fire rate over 2.3 TW capacity           | 1                   |
| Australia CEC (2024)         | 44% of solar fires from DC arcs (field data)           | 0.8                  |
| UK Fire Statistics (2024)    | 42 solar-related fires in 2023, mostly DC              | 0.1                  |
+------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+

Consolidated Estimate: 2 to 4 preventable DC-side fires occur daily worldwide.
This is likely underestimated due to underreporting!

Root Causes of DC Fires (industry averages)
	•	61%: Connector failure (mismatch, poor crimps, thermal cycling)
	•	24%: Insulation breakdown (UV, rodents, moisture ingress)
	•	15%: Junction box and cable arc faults

High-Risk Regions
	•	Dry climates: California, Spain, Australia (wildfire ignition)
	•	Rooftop markets: UK, Germany, Japan (building-integrated risk)

Outlook to 2030
With global PV expected to reach 8 TW by 2030, DC fires may exceed 10 per day unless protection is embedded at module level.

Why It Matters
	•	Each fire causes $250,000 to $2 million in damage (based on insurer claims)
	•	Electrocution risk is high at 1000–1500 VDC for firefighters and O&M crews
	•	Open-source module-level protection could prevent over 70% of incidents
