Module-Level DC Arc Suppression and Insulation Fault Disconnection Circuit (CERN OHL-S v2)

# Open Hardware Arc Protection Circuit for PV Modules

This open hardware design enables **sub-microsecond, MCU-free disconnection** of PV modules under arc fault, insulation leakage, or cable failure conditions.  
Built for **wildfire prevention**, **rooftop safety**, and **nuclear-grade EMI immunity**, it uses only analog components â€” no firmware, no software, no false alarms.
